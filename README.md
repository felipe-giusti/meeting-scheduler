# Meeting Scheduler
## Automation of meeting creation / email notification for Zoom and MS Teams

This is an automation project to create meetings or events given a pdf template.

The user will be able to select in which service the meeting needs to be created and input a pdf file to generate the meeting on the selected service, an email can also be sent to participants.

## Coding practice

This project (helped me practice and) has some examples of:
* OAuth 2.0 Authentication via Device flow - Zoom + Azure
* Pdf scraper + data aquisition using PyMuPDF
* Implementation of Cache with Time to Live (TTL Cache) from scratch
* Development of User Interface (WIP)

## Future project ideas
- PDF Template creation / Auto detection / other ways to input data
- improve UI / create a screen -> (I need to get better at frontend)
- Include other services / make it easier to setup / login
-  improve caching

## How to use it (* Will rewrite later)
1. Set up app variables - projectId and tenantID -- (WIP)
2. install dependencies (?) -- change later
3. run interface -- change later
